How to update your Git credentials on Windows:
go to Control Panel -> Credential Manager -> Generic Credentials -> windows credentials

warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in Bash/bash.sh
In Unix systems the end of a line is represented with a line feed (LF). 
In windows a line is represented with a carriage return (CR) and a line feed (LF) thus (CRLF). 
when you get code from git that was uploaded from a unix system they will only have an LF.

bat "git clone -b ${branchName} https://${comm_git_clone_token}@${gitRepo} ${folder}";
sh "scl enable rh-git29 -- git clone -b ${branchName} https://${comm_git_clone_token}@${gitRepo}";


git clone -b br_name https://kmacharla@github.angio.net/reponame

git reset : on the commit level, resetting is a way to move the tip of a branch to a different commit
git checkout hotfix
git reset HEAD~2

git revert : Reverting undoes a commit by creating a new commit
git checkout hotfix
git revert HEAD~2


To search the commit log (across all branches) for the given text:
git log --all --grep='Build 0051'
To search the actual content of commits through a repo's history, use:
git grep 'Build 0051' $(git rev-list --all)

I put this in my ~/.gitconfig:
[alias]
    find = log --pretty=\"format:%Cgreen%H %Cblue%s\" --name-status --grep
Then I can type "git find string" and I get a list of all the commits containing that string in the message. 
For example, to find all commits referencing ticket #33:


git help # This very helpful command
git grep 'manifest' # shows the files name & statements which are having the serch word
git grep 'XXXXX' | grep -i 'fly'   # lists the files having a specific search word
