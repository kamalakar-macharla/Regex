warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in Bash/bash.sh
In Unix systems the end of a line is represented with a line feed (LF). 
In windows a line is represented with a carriage return (CR) and a line feed (LF) thus (CRLF). 
when you get code from git that was uploaded from a unix system they will only have an LF.
