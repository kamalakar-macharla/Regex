--- Fortify
It's a static code analyzer
commercial one, Basic access is free, subcription is there
app -> critical high medium low
create a report/schedule a report then send it to your team. this is not there in sonar
 It uses a build tool that runs on a source code file or set of files and converts it into an intermediate model that is optimized for security analysis by Fortify.
