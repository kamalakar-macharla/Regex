etc/ansible/hosts might look like this:

mail.example.com

The default module for the ansible command-line utility is the command module. 
You can use an ad-hoc task to call the command module and reboot all web servers in Atlanta, 10 at a time. 
Before Ansible can do this, you must have all servers in Atlanta listed in a a group called [atlanta] in your inventory, 
and you must have working SSH credentials for each machine in that group. To reboot all the servers in the [atlanta] group:

$ ansible atlanta -a "/sbin/reboot"
