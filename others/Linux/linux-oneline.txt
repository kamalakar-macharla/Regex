SSH is a client-server based protocol. This means the protocol allows a device requesting information or services (the client) to connect to another device (the server). When a client connects to a server over SSH, the machine can be controlled like a local computer.

Secure Shell, sometimes referred to as Secure Socket Shell, is a protocol which allows you to connect securely to a remote computer or a server by using a text-based interface.
When a secure SSH connection is established, a shell session will be started,

Use SSH key pairs for authentication for passwordless SSH login.

authorized_keys2  id_dsa       known_hosts
config            id_dsa.pub
