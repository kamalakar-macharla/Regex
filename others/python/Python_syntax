# Python String Formatters
# Use %s where you want a value to appear. After the string, put a % operator and mention the identifiers in parameters.
x=10;  printer="HP"
print("I just printed %s pages to the printer %s" % (x, printer)) # here single quotes also work

# Format Method
print("I just printed {0} pages to the printer {1}".format(x, printer))
print("I  just printed {x} pages to the printer {printer}".format(x=7, printer='HP'))

#f-strings
# If you use an f-string, you just need to mention the identifiers in curly braces. Also, write ‘f’ right before the string, but outside the quotes used.

print(f"I just printed {x} pages to the printer {printer}") # here single quotes also work
