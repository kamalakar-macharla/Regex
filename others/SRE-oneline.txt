SRE = Define Availability
	  Level of availability
	  plan in case of failure
	  
Define (services level objectives) in collaboration with product owner. by agreeing these metrics in advance
we make sure that there is a less of change of confusion and conflict in the feaute.
SLO is just an agreement among stakeholders about how reliable service should be.

Every application has unique set of requirement that dectate how the reliable does it has to be before customer no longer notice the difference.
what is availability in the context of service?

SLI : are most often metrics over time such as 
	  request latency, 
      throughput of request per second in case of a batch system.
	  or 
	  failure per total number of request
	  
	They are usually aggregated over time,and we typically apply a function like a percentile
	like a 99 percentile or a median
	And that way, we can get to a concrete threshold which we can define to say,
	is this single number good or bad?
