openshift : This container orchestration engine do the following tasks.
	1) takes source code from git url and build
	2) takes the image from Docker hub
	3) creating container from image
	4) deploying the build to container
	5) creating a service and route (External url to access the app)

To see a typical example  : udemy : openshift developers workshop 17. Demo: Install and Run wordpress on PHP and MySql
youtube : OpenShift for Beginners - CI/CD & DevOps - Builds and Build Triggers

Openshift Registry
Docker hub
Other Registry

image streams are pointers to the actual docker images (image id's)

route : using route application can be accessed by outside world 
access the application using service IP within in the cluster.


udemy : openshift developers workshop : 3. overview of the openshift

Openshift : offers the ability to deploy your web application code using a library of predefined platform images that build your environment,
	openshift also allows you to build and obtain your docker images and use them quickly deploy your application on top of them.
	openshift provides web based console that makes it easy to perform managing deployment, pod's creating services, routes

docker : light weight portable image which has dependencies, and system libraries to run the application. Openshift uses a docker images.


OC (cli) : command line interface for Openshift.

Name space : All resources within a namespace are accessible as a whole. user access with namespace will always have access to all resources within namespace.

Project : wrap the namespace and provides security model based on users and groups.

POD : pods are basic unit, pod resides in single node, pod can contains one or more containers. each pod will their own IP address.

Containers : containers within a pod will share the same IP address & also share the storage. container snipup form the images.

Route : act as load balancer across the pod's 

DNS : this provides accessible name , that application to be accessed.

Service Layer : Provides internal communication between application components in OpenShift. Service. A service is a set of replicated pods. Generally used to define a consumable application function

How openshift works : Openshift is built on the top of the core technologies docker based containers and kubernetes system for orchestration.

Routes : Pods are also made available to external world outside the cluster uring routes.

DNS : the external DNS entry that is created to point to the service so it can be accessed.

Relication : Management pod is controlled by relication controller which ensures that a specified number of replicas of POD are running all the time.

Build configuration : holds the definition of how to build a new image to be deployed.
	Source to image : will download the base application server image, clone your code repository run the build, a new docker image
	that contains your whole stack and deploy this build and start of the resulting container.

Build process : produces and image that gets stored in an integrated docker registry and is used for the application deployment,
	or nodes open shift tracks images through the image stream component.

Deployment Configuration : defines their template for the pod and manages the deployment of new images or configuration changes.

Replication Controller : manage the pod's and keep them running.

What's the difference between a Service and a Deployment in Kubernetes? 
	A deployment is responsible for keeping a set of pods running. 
	A service is responsible for enabling network access to a set of pods. 
	We could use a deployment without a service to keep a set of identical pods running in the Kubernetes cluster.




service can be accessed on cluster level, using the cURL command.

service : A Kubernetes service serves as an internal load balancer. Service provides a consistent address pods while pods are being added and removed.
service
0 identifies a set of replicated pods in order to proxy the connections it receives to them.
The default service clusterIP addresses are from the OpenShift Container Platform internal network and they are used to permit pods to access each other.
