Creating an Artifactory Server Instance in scripted pipeline
To upload or download files to and from your Artifactory server, you need to create an Artifactory server instance in your Pipeline script.

If your Artifactory server is already defined in Jenkins, you only need its server ID which can be obtained  under Manage | Configure System.

Then, to create your Artifactory server instance, add the following line to your script:

	def server = Artifactory.server 'my-server-id'
If your Artifactory is not defined in Jenkins you can still create it as follows:

	def server = Artifactory.newServer url: 'artifactory-url', username: 'username', password: 'password'
You can also user Jenkins Credential ID instead of username and password:

	def server = Artifactory.newServer url: 'artifactory-url', credentialsId: 'ccrreeddeennttiiaall'
You can modify the server object using the following methods:
