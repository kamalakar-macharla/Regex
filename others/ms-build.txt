MSBuild in the previous versions of .NET Framework was installed with it but, they decided to install it with Visual Studio or with the package BuildTools_Full.exe.

The path to MSBuild when installed with the .NET framework:

C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework[64 or empty][framework_version]

The path to MSBuild when installed with Visual Studio is:

C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild[version]\Bin for x86 and, C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild[version]\Bin\amd64 for x64.

The path when BuildTools_Full.exe is installed is the same as when MSBuild is installed with Visual Studio.

Adding MSBuild to class path, so that it can be access from command line

buildtools_full.exe is an executable file that is part of the Microsoft Build Tools 2015 program developed by Microsoft Corporation.

What is Microsoft build tools?
MSBuild is a build tool that helps automate the process of creating a software product, including 
compiling the source code, packaging, testing, deployment and creating documentations. 
With MSBuild, it is possible to build Visual Studio projects and solutions without the Visual Studio IDE installed.


Azure development build tools: MSBuild tasks and Targets for building Azure applications

MSBuild.exe MyProject.proj -t:rebuild

You can use Azure Pipelines to automatically compile, test, and deploy your application. 
Your build system can automatically run builds when developers check in code (for example, as part of a Continuous Integration strategy) or according to a schedule (for example, a nightly Build Verification Test build). Azure Pipelines compiles your code by using MSBuild.

An msbuild file defines the process for running a build of your code - generally for an automated build like a Continuous Integration build.
