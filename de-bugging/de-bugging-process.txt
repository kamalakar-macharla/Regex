In Unix systems the end of a line is represented with a line feed (LF). 
In windows a line is represented with a carriage return (CR) and a line feed (LF) thus (CRLF). 
when you get code from git that was uploaded from a unix system they will only have an LF.
If you are a single developer working on a windows machine, and you don't care that git automatically replaces LFs to CRLFs, 
you can turn this warning off by typing the following in the git command line
