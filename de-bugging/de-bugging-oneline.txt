dos2unix: converting file udemy-urls.sh to Unix format...
unix2dos:

In Unix systems the end of a line is represented with a line feed (LF).
In windows a line is represented with a carriage return (CR) and a line feed (LF) thus (CRLF). 
when you get code from git that was uploaded from a unix system they will only have an LF.
If you are a single developer working on a windows machine, and you don't care that git automatically replaces LFs to CRLFs, 

file : this command shows whether its line based file or unix based file.
file ./Bash/bash-oneline.sh
./Bash/bash-oneline.sh: Bourne-Again shell script, UTF-8 Unicode text executable, with CRLF line terminators.
